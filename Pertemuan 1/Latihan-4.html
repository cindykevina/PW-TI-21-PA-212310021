	<h1> The 10 Most Popular Programming Languages to Learn in 2022</h1>
	There’s no question that software programming is a hot career right now. <span style="color: red
    ;">The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</span> projects 21 percent growth for programming jobs from 2018 to 2028, which is more than four times the average for all occupations. What’s more, the median annual pay for a software programmer is about $106,000, which nearly three times the median pay for all U.S. workers.
	<p>Not all programming jobs are the same, however. Different roles, companies, and types of software require knowing and understanding different programming languages—and it’s often beneficial to know multiple languages. Trying to break into the field of software programming can be a daunting experience, especially for professionals with no prior programming experience.</p>
	<p>The <span style="color: rgb(47, 0, 255);"><u> Master of Science in Computer Science Align program</u></span> at Northeastern University is specifically designed for students who want to transition into computer science from another field of study.</p>
	<p>“Our aim is to transport students from a variety of different backgrounds and have them come out as software engineers,” says Ian Gorton, PhD and director of the graduate computer science programs at Northeastern University—Seattle. “We focus on math, programming, and a variety of computer science and engineering concepts.”</p>
	<p>Whether you’re new to programming or looking to brush up on your skills, it helps to know which languages are in high demand. Here are 10 of the most popular programming languages of 2020 based on the number of job postings listed on job search site Indeed, the average annual salary for those jobs, and factors such as ease of use and potential for growth.</p>
